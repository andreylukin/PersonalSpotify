# PersonalSpotify
This is a personal project of mine, with which I will try to enhance my Spotify experience. 

What I am interested to do with this project is to graph the artists/songs/genres I listen to over time and see if I have any types of listening cycles that I always thought I do have.

I also thought it would be an interesting feature to be notified when something I usually dont notice happen with my listening, maybe me listening to a really unpopular artist.


One thing that I cared about a lot is to keep track of the genres I am listening to. After some checks, Spotify almost never has any genres available for albums and doesn't always have genres available for artists, so I will union that data with wikipedia data to try to find possible genres.


I will keep everything on Firebase since it will be the least hassle to keep track of.


Currently, here is my todo list:

Since I am taking some ML and AI classes next semester, I will try  to encorporate data analytics stuff into it as well.
